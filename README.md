# Unobtrusive Umbrellas

A resource pack for [Artifacts](https://modrinth.com/mod/artifacts) to get the Umbrella out of your eyes!  Like a "low shield" pack but for the Umbrella artifact.  

You love the Umbrella from Artifacts, don't you? Of course you do, and why wouldn't you!? It's a shield with infinite durability that makes you immune to fall damage and gives you slow falling?  
Honestly, it's one of the best accessories in all of modded Minecraft, and fashionable to boot!  
Do you know what you don't love about the Umbrella? It's just so *blinding* and gets in your way, I mean this is a combat item you say to yourself and all of your friends who think you look like dollar tree marry poppins... and I get it, except for the last part that sounds like a skill issue.  
This pack fixes all of it though, even your condescending friendships through the power of very slight adjustments to a couple of models.

## Examples

These screenshots are taken on a 2560x1440 (16:9) monitor in fullscreen downscaled to 50%, gui scale of 3, 70 fov, with a perfectly level looking angle.  
The HUD is being retextured by [Overgrown Flowery GUI](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/overgrown-flowery-gui) (it may look discolored because of green screen shenanigans lol).

### Some Science  

This "in-depth" analysis scientifically proves that this resource pack will aid you in PVP and PVE combat!  
Assuming the only reason you're failing in combat is that your beloved umbrella got in the way of your vision.  
These numbers showcase a 3-4x reduction in screen space usage, hooray!
